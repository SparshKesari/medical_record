# medical_record

Medi-Assist is a web application which is set-up to provide patients a platform to maintain their medical records at one place. The functionality of this application is as such that it helps the user feed in any previous medical records, any upcoming ones as well and creates a record of their medical history so that their doctor can refer to it while treating them. It stores all the prescriptions via manually adding them through a form. The application also categorizes the medication according to the ailment and keeps your current health record updated with information like weight, haemoglobin, insulin levels, etc. This app facilitates the patient to review his medicine prescription accordingly to the disease and helps in maintaining a record at one place instead of different papers of each prescription.


It has been made with a very user friendly interface to ensure the person using the application faces no complication. The user just has to LOGIN with his credentials or SIGN-UP as a new user and then fill out the ADD FORM to add new prescribed medicines or even add previous prescription to maintain the health record.


Few of the latest Dev-Ops tools have been used to build the project like Github Actions for version control, Selenium for testing, Postman for API testing and Docker for dockerization. Using such tools makes this web application easier to update with features, manage test runs and release in the market with ease.
